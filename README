DESCRIPTION:

This code allows to do a joint decomposition and reconstruction of tomographic data.
The decomposition is done by identifying a geometry component (piecewise constant) and
a texture (locally fast-varying elements).
The problem is formulated as follows:        
                        minimize          0.5*||F*x^t||_2^2 + alpha*TV(x^g)
                 for x^t and x^g in R^N
                       subject to          -chi<= H*(x^t+x^g)-y <= chi
                                                0 <= x^t+x^g <= 1
Where: F=I_N-Delta and Delta is the Laplacian edge detection operator
       TV is the total variation seminorm
       alpha is a regularization parameter
       x^t and x^g are the texture and the geometry, respectively
       H is the observation operator (radon transform)
       y is the tomographic data
       chi is th measurement uncertainty
The minimization process is based on a Proximal Interior Point Algorithm (PIPA).

This toolbox consists of 2 subfolders:
1) data: contains data for three real images of materials (glass, AlCu, basalt), and the operator H
2) functions: contains the decomposition/reconstruction programs
